# Boris bikes challenge

**Authors:** Omar Alvarez & Emma Sjöström

This is the first project for Ronin April 2016 cohort.

This first challenge is about the Boris Bike system in London.

Boris Bikes is London's self-service, bike-sharing scheme for short journeys
You can hire a bike from as little as *£2*. Simply go to any docking station with your bank card and touch the screen to get started.
There's no need to book - hire a bike, ride it where you like, then return it to any docking station.

We built a program that will run all the docking stations, simulate all the bikes,
and emulate all the infrastructure required to make a London bike system fully functional.

The full project is divided into 22 challenges and they all build on one another.
